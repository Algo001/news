# project newsy -news website-

This news website offers daily news briefings on a range of topics, including politics, business, technology, sports, and entertainment. Its modern and sleek design features a navigation bar that allows users to browse different categories of news, with a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes.

The website employs JavaScript to fetch news articles from the News API. Users can select their preferred category and country to read about, and the website displays the latest news articles that match those criteria. The articles are presented in a visually appealing card format, with a title, description, author, publication date, source, and a link to read more. The site also includes a share button that enables users to share the article's URL.

If there are no news articles available for the selected category and country, the website displays an error message. Similarly, if there is an error retrieving the news articles, an error message is also displayed.

***Please note that to fully experience the website and its features, you will need to use your own API key from News API. I recommend obtaining your own API key and modifying the code accordingly for your own use.***
